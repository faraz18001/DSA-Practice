Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

both of the linked lists are converted to the pythonic lists 
then we reverse both of them ,
add the first one to the second or secodng witth first order doesn't matter here

we need to worry about the carry system

def add_two(arr1:list,arr2:list):
    return arr1 + arr2
