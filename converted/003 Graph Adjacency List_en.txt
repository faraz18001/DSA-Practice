So now let's look at creating an adjacency list.
That's just going to be a different way of representing this graph that we just looked at in the last
video.
And with an adjacency list, we're going to represent this with a dictionary.
Let's start with our a vertex.
It has edges with B and E and will represent this in our dictionary.
Like this A is the key and we'll have a list for the value in our key value pair in the dictionary.
And that list will hold all of the edges that a has with other vertices.
So now let's start moving around this circle here.
So we'll look at B, it has edges with A and C.
C has edges with B and D.
D has edges with C and E.
And then finally E has edges with A and D.
So now this adjacency list on the right represents the picture on the left.
And an adjacency list is what we're going to use to create our graphs in this course.
And that is our overview of an adjacency list.
