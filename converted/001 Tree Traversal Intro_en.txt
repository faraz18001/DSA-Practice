So now we're going to do tree traversal.
And what Treach reversal is, is that we're going to visit every node in the tree and they're we're
going to take the values and put them in a list and then will return that list.
But treach reversal is a little more complicated than doing something like a linked list because with
a linked list, because it's just linear, if we're going to reverse this, we just start at the beginning
and then we just go through the list.
But with a tree, there are multiple ways to visit each node.
We could do something like this where we start at the top and then we do the next row like this, and
then we do the next row like this and so on.
This is called breadth.
First search.
Another way that we could do this is we could start all the way to the bottom left and then come up
and then come down and then come up to the first item and then go all the way to the bottom left of
the items remaining like this and then come up and then come down.
And this is an example of what is called depth first search, and we're going to look at three different
ways of doing depth, first search.
But for now, that is our quick overview of traversal.
