Now, let's look at how we do insertions sort of to bring up this list here and with insertions sort,
we always start with the second item in the list.
And then what we do is we compare it to the item before it, if it's less than the item before we're
going to do this and we'll drop that in to the correct spot, then we go to the next item and we do
the same thing.
We compare it to the item before that this one is not less than so.
We don't move this one.
This one, we compare it to the six, we move this over, we compare it to the four.
It's not less than the four.
We dropped that in.
And then the one we're going to compare that to the six and the five and the four and then finally the
two, we put that there, we drop this.
And that was actually going to be a special case, the one that goes all the way to the beginning.
And we'll talk about that when we code that.
And then the last one here will move this over until we finally compare it to the two, it's not less
than the two.
So that one goes there.
And then once that three gets dropped in there, that's the last item.
And that means that the entire list is sorted.
In the next video, when we code this, we're going to start out with a list that looks like this.
We're just going to swap these two items to make things a little bit easier so we don't have to walk
through as many steps.
And this is where we'll pick up in the next video when we code insertion sort.
