There are a few ways in which we can simplify our Big O notation, and we'll look at a few of those
as we go through this section.
The first that we're going to look at is called Drop Constants.
So we're going to start this with this same for loop that we had in the last video that was O of n.
But we're going to make a change to this.
We're going to add a second for loop right after this.
It's identical, except we're going to change it from an I to a J, but is otherwise identical.
They are each going to run n times, so let's flip over to VS Code and have a look at this.
Okay, so there is our function with two for loops and we're going to run this with the number ten.
And you can see our output there.
It goes from zero through nine here and another zero through nine here.
It's just the exact same thing, running twice.
So we pass this the number ten here, and it printed out 20 items.
So let's flip back over.
So this ran n plus n times or 2n times.
Now, you might think that we're going to write this as O of 2n, but we can simplify this.
By dropping the constant.
So it doesn't matter if it's O of 2n 10n 100n.
We drop the constant and we just write it as O of n.
So our first rule for simplifying.
Is drop constants.
