So the binary tree we looked at in the last video was a binary tree, but it wasn't a binary search
tree.
In order for it to be a binary search tree, the nodes have to be laid out in a particular way.
So let's take a look at that.
So let's say we have one node in our tree and we're going to add another node with a binary search tree.
If the number is greater than it's going to go on the right of that node.
And if it's less than it's going to go on the left of that node.
And because 76 is greater than we're going to place it there.
Now, let's take a look at another node.
The 52 is greater than 47, and we're always going to start by comparing it to the node at the top.
And because it's greater than we're going to go to the right, but there's already a node there.
So what we're going to do is we're going to compare that 52 to the 76 and because it's less than 76.
That goes on the left of that node.
So let's look at another node at 21.
We're always going to start at the top and because the spot to the left of the 47 is open.
We'll place it right there.
So let's just look at a few more here.
We'll say 82.
We'll start at the 47.
It's greater than we'll go to the right.
We'll compare it to the 76 is greater than, again, in this case, that spot is open.
So we'll place it.
18.
It is less than 47.
So we go to the left and we look at the 21.
It's less than the 21 that spots open.
So we'll place that there.
And one final node, we'll start at the 47.
It's less than we go left to the 21.
27 is greater than the 21.
So we place that on the right.
So a couple of things to point out about a binary search tree.
If you take any node in the binary search tree, all nodes below it to the right are going to be greater
than that node.
Everything on the left is going to be less than.
And that is our overview.
Of binary search trees.
