So in this video, we're going to look high level at what is required to delete a node from a binary
search tree.
And there are two parts to this.
First, if we're going to delete that 27 node, we have to start at the root and then traverse down
to the 21 node and then finally get down to the 27 node.
So the first part of this is we have to be able to traverse through the tree.
And then the second part is once we find this node, we have to be able to delete it.
Now in this situation we are deleting a leaf node, and that's our simplest scenario.
But what if we have nodes on the left?
How do we delete the 27 node then?
Well, this is actually easier than you might think.
We just need to move this up and this is a valid binary search tree.
So now let's look at the situation.
When we have a subtree on the right, we can actually do the same thing here and move this subtree up.
And this is once again a valid binary search tree.
Where it gets more complicated is if we have a subtree on each side, we can't just move one of these
sub trees up.
So what we're going to do here is we're going to look at the subtree on the right of the node that we
want to delete and we'll find the node with the lowest value.
That's going to be the 28 node.
And we're going to copy that value of 28 into this node up here.
Now, let me be clear.
We're not moving that 28 node up.
We're just copying the value into the existing node.
And at the moment that we do that, we have 228 nodes in the binary search tree.
So then what we're going to do is remove that second 28 node.
And now this is a valid binary search tree.
And the next few videos, we will walk through all of these scenarios.
But for now, that is our introduction to delete node.
