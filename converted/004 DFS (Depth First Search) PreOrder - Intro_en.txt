So I had mentioned in the first video for traversal that there would be three types of depth first search
that we would look at, the first one that we're going to look at is going to be pre order.
I'm going to bring up a tree like this.
And with preorder the order that we're going to add the numbers to the list will be like this will start
at the top, will add the forty seven.
And then after that, we're just going to keep moving to the left.
So we'll put the twenty one into the list and then the 18.
And this is as far as we can go to the left.
So we're going to come back up to the twenty one and go to the right there.
And now we've looked at everything to the left of the 47.
So now we'll go right and then after the 76 we always go left first will come down to the 52, come
back up to the 76 and down to the 82.
And that is the order that those will be added to the list.
And will code this in the next video, but that is our intro to Preorder Depth First Search.
