Now let's look at cues.
And cues are something we're all familiar with.
We join a queue whenever we get in line and then there's other people that can get in line behind us.
But if you were there first, you will be the first person out of the line.
This is called FIFO.
First in, first out.
And when we add people to the queue like this, we use the term in queue.
When we remove people from the queue like this, we use the term D queue.
Now let's look at a couple of data structures that we could potentially use to create a queue.
Let's start with a list.
So for something to be a cue, you add on one end in, you remove on the other end.
With a list.
Removing and adding from the end is o of one.
But on the other end removing and adding is o of n.
So if you have a queue, let's say we're going to add on this end and we're going to remove on this
end we have one way that is O of N and the other way that is O of one.
Likewise, if we add on this end and remove on this end we still have one end that's O of n and one
end that is O of one.
Now let's compare this.
To a link list.
With a link list.
Removing is o of pn on the end, but adding it back on is of one.
On the other end, removing AZO of one and adding it back on is also OAV one.
So you have three of ones here and one o of n.
And that means what you don't want to do is you don't want to dequeue from this end.
You want to enqueue from this end and dequeue from this end because both of those are o of one.
With a linked list we call these head and tail a change that we're going to have for it to be a Q as
we're just going to call these first and last.
And that is our intro.
To Qs.
