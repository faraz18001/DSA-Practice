So in order to look at all of the values in a linked list, I've created a method called print list.
So I'll just walk through this quickly.
It's pretty simple.
It's called print list.
Do we have the variable temp equal to self dot head like this and then we just have a while loop that
goes through the list.
And while temp is not none.
In other words, we haven't reached the end of the list.
We're going to print temp value.
In this case, that's 11.
And then we say temp equals temp dot next.
And that just moves that over and we'll print the three and the 23 and the seven.
Then we reach the end where temp is equal to none, and then we stop running the loop.
So this is pretty simple.
We'll be using this as we go through the linked list methods that we're going to create.
I just want to point out that this is not a built in method.
I am creating this and I've also created similar methods to print out the contents of all of the other
data structures that we're going to create in the course.
I won't walk through that when we get to the other data structures, but understand when we do print
graph, that is something that has been created.
All right.
That is print list.
