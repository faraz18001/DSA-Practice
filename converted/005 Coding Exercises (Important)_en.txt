So now that we're getting into writing the code for our first data structure, I want to remind you
of the two different ways you can access the coding exercises in this course.
So I'm going to flip over to the course and then if you come up here to the constructor video, the
one we just watched and you click on the resources tab, underneath that tab there is an exercise file.
If you click on this, that is the exercise that goes with that video and you can access the same exercise
file by scrolling to the bottom down here and clicking on coding exercises.
And all the same coding exercises are down here.
So I'm going to click on this one for the constructor.
It's the same one we just downloaded that, that will load this and I've marked out exactly where you're
supposed to write the code.
Or you can see here it says write node constructor here and linked list constructor here and I already
have the correct code copied.
I'm just going to paste it here and then you come down here where it says Check solution and it says,
Well done, your solution is correct.
So you can write all of this code down here as well.
And if you do get stuck, I do have the solution over here and that's the same code that I just copied
in.
So I'm going to encourage you to take a moment and do this coding exercise for the constructor.
And then if you look over here, you can see that there are dozens and dozens of these coding exercises
that will be used throughout the course.
And I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to do the coding exercises.
