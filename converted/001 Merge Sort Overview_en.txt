Now, let's do merge sort.
So the idea behind merged sort is this if you have two sorted lists and these are both sorted, it is
very easy to combine these into a new sorted list.
So let's say we started with a list with eight items unsorted like this, what murd sort is going to
do is first break this list in half and break it in half again and break it in half again until the
only thing that we have left are lists that only have one item in them.
So there will be eight separate lists with one item in each list and a list with one item in it is by
definition sorted.
So now that you've gotten these all down to single item lists, we can take two of the items.
And create a new list that's sorted and we'll do that with the next two.
And so on, until we have four less in this case with two items each, that will do it again with these
two lists like that and with those two lists.
And now we can take these two lists and combine them into one sorted list.
And that is our high level overview of Mirch sort.
